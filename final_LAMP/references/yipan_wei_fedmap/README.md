  <sub><em><strong>Motivation overview.</strong> Medical image features often suffer from manifold collapse and cross-client topological misalignment, making purely textual prompt tuning unreliable under federated heterogeneity.</em></sub>
</p>

## 📌 Introduction

Federated prompt learning adapts vision-language models to privacy-sensitive medical image classification by exchanging only lightweight prompt parameters. Most existing methods focus on **textual tuning**, assuming that the frozen CLIP image encoder already provides a reliable visual geometry.

**FedMAP** challenges this assumption. In medical images, subtle morphology and cross-center acquisition shifts can collapse discriminative visual directions and misalign class topology across clients. FedMAP shifts the paradigm from textual prompt adaptation to **visual manifold anchoring**, using semantic anchors and topology-aware regularization to reshape the client-side visual space without exposing raw medical images.

The current release provides the public training code, dataset wrappers, semantic-anchor tensors, baseline trainers, and launcher scripts needed to reproduce the public FedISIC and FedCamelyon17 protocols. Private medical data used in the paper is not redistributed.

## 🎯 Motivation

FedMAP targets two geometric failure modes of medical federated prompt learning: intra-client manifold collapse and inter-client topological misalignment.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/motivation-rank.png" alt="Effective-rank evidence for medical manifold collapse" width="78%">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <sub><em><strong>Medical manifold collapse.</strong> Frozen CLIP visual features have lower effective rank on medical datasets than on natural-image domains, indicating compressed class manifolds.</em></sub>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/motivation-consistency.png" alt="Neighborhood-consistency evidence for medical topological misalignment" width="78%">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <sub><em><strong>Topological misalignment.</strong> Medical clients exhibit lower neighborhood consistency, showing that local visual geometry is less stable across sites.</em></sub>
</p>

These observations suggest that shifting text prompts alone is insufficient: the visual manifold itself needs a stable semantic reference during federated optimization.

## 🧠 Methods

FedMAP inserts lightweight visual prompts into the frozen CLIP image encoder. A server-side semantic codebook is built from class labels and LLM-derived attributes, then used as a client-invariant synchronization signal. Each client optimizes visual prompts with classification supervision plus geometry-aware losses, and the server aggregates only prompt parameters.

<p align="center">
  <sub><em><strong>FedMAP pipeline.</strong> Manifold Semantic Anchoring aligns image features to semantic anchors, while Topology Structural Alignment preserves class-relation structure across clients.</em></sub>
</p>

FedMAP has three main ingredients:

- **Manifold Semantic Anchoring:** aligns visual features with semantic anchors to recover discriminative directions suppressed by medical manifold collapse.
- **Topology Structural Alignment:** distills a text-derived class-relation matrix into the visual prototype geometry, reducing cross-client structural drift.
- **Federated visual prompting:** uploads only lightweight visual prompts for FedAvg-style aggregation while keeping image data local.

## ✨ Contributions

- **A geometry-first view of medical FPL:** We identify medical manifold collapse and inter-client topological misalignment as two failure modes of text-centric federated prompt learning.
- **Visual Manifold Anchoring:** FedMAP uses semantic anchors and relation alignment to reshape visual features rather than only shifting text-side decision boundaries.
- **Lightweight federated adaptation:** The method updates compact visual prompts, giving strong performance with low communication overhead.
- **Consistent empirical gains:** FedMAP improves accuracy and Macro-F1 across FedISIC, FedCamelyon17, and the private ultrasound benchmark reported in the paper.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ⚙️ Setup Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YipanWei/FedMAP.git
cd FedMAP

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fedmap
```

The environment file is exported from the development environment used for the public release. It pins Python `3.10.15`, PyTorch `2.4.0`, the PyTorch CUDA `12.1` runtime, and the auxiliary packages required by the local Dassl, CLIP, and trainer implementations.

### 🩺 Data Preparation

Put raw datasets under:

```text
Scripts/data/
```

The public release supports:

| Dataset key | Dataset wrapper | Clients |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `fedisic` | `FedISIC` | 6 |
| `fedcamelyon` | `FedCamelyon17MD` | 5 |

Dataset behavior is controlled by YAML files in `Scripts/configs/datasets/`. Minimal semantic resources are kept under `Scripts/embeddings/<dataset>/text/`; `*_template_attributes.pt` is used by `FedMAP`, and `*_class_attributes.pt` is used by `FedMVP`.

The repository does not redistribute raw medical datasets. Users should obtain datasets from their official sources and arrange them according to the dataset wrappers.

### 🏃 Run Experiments

Run FedMAP on FedISIC:

```bash
bash Scripts/run_experiment.sh \
  --trainer FedMAP \
  --dataset fedisic \
  --seed 1 \
  --gpu 0
```

Switch method or dataset:

```bash
bash Scripts/run_experiment.sh --trainer FedCLIP --dataset fedcamelyon --seed 1 --gpu 0
bash Scripts/run_experiment.sh --trainer FedMVP  --dataset fedisic     --seed 42 --gpu 1
```

Run a short smoke test:

```bash
bash Scripts/run_experiment.sh \
  --trainer FedProxLPT \
  --dataset fedisic \
  --seed 1 \
  --gpu 0 \
  --num_workers 0 \
  OPTIM.ROUND 2 OPTIM.MAX_EPOCH 1 OUTPUT_DIR output/smoke_fedproxlpt
```

Extra arguments after the launcher options are passed directly to `federated_main.py` and the YACS config system.

## 📊 Main Results

FedMAP consistently improves over federated prompt-learning and CLIP adaptation baselines on dermoscopy, histopathology, and a private ultrasound benchmark. The private benchmark is reported as part of the paper results, but the public code release does not redistribute private data.

Local-only folders such as `Scripts/output/`, `Scripts/logs/`, raw `Scripts/data/`, caches, and internal notes are intentionally excluded from git.

## 🧪 Reproducibility

Default public configs use `50` federated rounds and `1` local epoch:

```text
OPTIM.ROUND: 50
OPTIM.MAX_EPOCH: 1
```

Paper results are reported over three random seeds:

```text
1, 42, 10086
```

Supported public trainers:

| Trainer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `FedMAP` | Visual prompt tuning with manifold semantic anchoring and topology structural alignment. |
| `VPT` | Visual prompt tuning baseline. |
| `PROMPTFL` | Federated prompt learning baseline. |
| `FedCLIP` | Federated CLIP-style prompt baseline. |
| `FedAPT` | Federated adaptive prompt tuning baseline. |
| `FedCoCoOP` | Federated CoCoOP-style baseline. |
| `FedKgCoOP` | Knowledge-guided CoCoOP-style baseline. |
| `FedMVP` | Multi-view prompt baseline. |
| `FedProxLPT` | FedProx regularized language prompt tuning baseline. |
| `FOCoOP` | Federated out-of-distribution CoOp-style baseline. |
| `CLIP` | Zero-shot / frozen CLIP reference. |

Outputs are generated locally:

```text
Scripts/output/<dataset>/beta:<beta>/<trainer>/
Scripts/logs/
```

These folders are ignored by git so the public repository remains lightweight. The public release has been smoke-tested with all listed trainers on `fedisic` using `OPTIM.ROUND=1`, and a 2-round regression check was run for `FedProxLPT`.
